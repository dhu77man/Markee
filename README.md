# Usage
<code>
var locations[
  ['*1*', '*2*', '*3*', '*4*'], <br>
  ['*1*', '*2*', '*3*', '*4*']
];
</code>
To use this, you would replace *1* with the HTML you want to display the marker with.
This will be what the marker looks like on the map, so make it look speical!

Replace *2* with the latitude of the pin, and the same with *3* but with the longitude.

*4* is a unique identifier for each pin, so just make that one auto-increment!
